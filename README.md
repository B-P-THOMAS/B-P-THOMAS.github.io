# ScaleConstructionJS
An animated musical scale diagram using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript

Instead of representing a scale as a *line*, I draw it as a *circle*. The Major scale has a distinctive pattern of tones and semitones. The semitones are shaded gray to make them more obvious.

## Key to the diagram
The pale gray blob highlights the root note of the current **Major Scale**.

The solid green blob shows the root note of the current **Major Mode**.

The name of the Major Mode appears in the top left hand corner of the frame.

In the static snap above, the pale gray blob highlights B♭, and you can read off the notes of the B♭ Major scale by visiting each blob in a clockwise direction.
Likewise, the solid green blob is next to C, so you can read off the notes of the **C dorian** Major Mode by visiting each blob in a clockwise direction.

The neat thing is that each time you advance to a new scale, only one scale degree changes.
